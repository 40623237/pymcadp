The example could have been done in a more simple fashion, but this is the correct way of doing it: when closing the loop, you could have used a simple revolute joint. The problem with that is that if your 4 joints are not perfectly aligned, you could have additional constraints blocking or hindering your mechanism. For that reason we close the loop with a spherical joint mounted on a prismatic joint.
