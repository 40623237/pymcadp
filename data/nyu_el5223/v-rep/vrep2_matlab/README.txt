The files remApi.m, remoteApiProto.m, and remoteApi.dll should be placed in this folder.
The files remApi.m and remoteApiProto.m are under the programming->remoteApiBindings->matlab->matlab folder in the v-rep installation.
remoteApi.dll is under the programming->remoteApiBindings->lib->lib folder in the v-rep installation. If you are on Linux or Mac, you will need the file remoteApi.so or remoteApi.dylib, respectively, instead of remoteApi.dll.
