The files vrep.py, vrepConst.py, and remoteApi.dll should be placed in this folder.
The files vrep.py and vrepConst.py are under the programming->remoteApiBindings->python->python folder in the v-rep installation.
remoteApi.dll is under the programming->remoteApiBindings->lib->lib folder in the v-rep installation. If you are on Linux or Mac, you will need the file remoteApi.so or remoteApi.dylib, respectively, instead of remoteApi.dll.
